# What is a scripting language?

A scripting language is a type of programming language that is typically used to automate tasks, control other software, or add functionality to applications without the need for compiling code. Scripting languages are often interpreted, meaning they are executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code.\

Key characteristics of scripting languages:\
1. Interpreted: Code is executed at runtime, without prior compilation.\
2. High-level: Easier to write and understand, abstracting much of the system-level operations.
3. Used for automation: Often used to automate repetitive tasks or enhance the functionality of existing systems.
4. Embedded: Frequently embedded into environments like web browsers or software applications (e.g., JavaScript in browsers, Python in automation scripts).\
5. Examples include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Bash. They are commonly used for web development, system administration, and task automation.
